Style Guide: Wired-In
This is your complete playbook—use it to keep every page sexy, fun, and flowing like Wired-In. Check it every time.
Point of View and Voice
Stick to one character’s head per chapter—close-up, like you’re living their thoughts and senses. Chapter 3 is Aerithyl’s world; Chapter 4 is Ryn’s.
Aerithyl: Dominant, sultry, predatory—her voice is smooth steel, her thoughts weave control. Example: “Aerithyl felt Vikki’s heat, her crimson eyes flaring with intent.” Uses “I,” “my,” “mine” normally.
Ryn: Stoic, steady, strained—his voice is low and clipped, his thoughts wrestle duty and lust. Example: “Ryn’s jaw tightened, heat creeping up his neck.”
Show everything through their eyes—touch, sound, smell, taste. Keep it raw and hot. Example: “The slick hum of Vikki’s tongue buzzed through Aerithyl’s skin.”
Pets’ Thoughts via Cyber Bond
Aerithyl hears her pets’ minds through the Cyber Bond—their wants, fears, heat. Write these as italicized whispers in her POV.
Example: Vikki licked slow, her thought pulsing—This one burns to please Mistress.
Example: Nyx squirmed, her mind hissing—I hate how much I crave this.
Only in Aerithyl’s chapters—Ryn’s not linked, so his POV skips this. Keep it subtle but constant when pets are around.
Dialogue Rules
Solo speech: Attach it to action on the same line, in quotes. Example: Vikki knelt, her hair brushing Aerithyl’s thigh. “This one’s yours, Mistress.”
Fast back-and-forth: Each line gets its own space, in quotes. Example:
 Aerithyl grinned, stroking Vikki’s hair. “How’s my treasure tonight?”
 “This one’s eager, Mistress.”
 “Prove it.”
Thoughts: No quotes, italicized via Bond for pets in Aerithyl’s POV. Example: This one’s tongue belongs here.
Tags: Use sparingly—action beats (e.g., “Nyx smirked”) usually show who’s talking.
Vikki’s Speech Pattern (Updated!)
Vikki alone doesn’t say “I,” “my,” “mine”—she’s all Aerithyl’s, no self left. Use “this one” or “this one’s” for her speech only.
Old (Vikki): “I want to please you.” → New: “This one wants to please Mistress.”
Example: “This one’s threads are yours to unravel, Mistress.”
Aerithyl and others speak normally—use “I,” “my,” etc. as usual. Example: Aerithyl purred, “I’ll break you slow.”
Keeps Vikki unique—her surrender shines in every word, soft and lilting.
What to Describe
Senses: Zoom in on touch (skin brushing), sound (wet licks, crop snaps), smell (ozone, musk), taste (sweat, heat). Make it vivid and sexy. Example: “Vikki’s tongue left a warm trail, her lilac scent curling up Aerithyl’s nose.”
Bodies: Highlight curves, muscles, scars, tattoos, piercings, cybernetics—check profiles every time. Example: “Nyx’s tattoos swirled, red welts blooming under her pale skin.”
Tech/Magic: Weave in circuits glowing, Bond buzzing, collars glinting—subtle but constant. Example: “Aerithyl’s glyphs pulsed, her will snaring Nyx tight.”
Setting: Neon lights, spire hums, steamy air—ground it in Zarath-9’s vibe. Example: “The chamber glowed violet, neon streaking the obsidian throne.”
How They Move
Match movement to personality—smooth and alive.
Aerithyl: Predatory, deliberate—stalks or lounges. Example: “Aerithyl leaned forward, her robe sliding open slow.”
Vikki: Graceful, fae-like—glides or sways. Example: “Vikki swayed in, hips rolling soft.”
Nyx: Slinking, taunting—prowls or crawls. Example: “Nyx slinked closer, hips sharp.”
They touch a lot—hands grip, lips tease, bodies press. Example: “Vikki’s fingers dug into Aerithyl’s thighs, steadying her lick.”
Layering Actions and Natural Flow
Don’t stop one action cold when someone new enters—let them overlap, bleed together, like real life.
How: Start with one pair (e.g., Aerithyl and Vikki), keep their heat going as another (e.g., Nyx) joins. Blend the new entry into the ongoing vibe.
Example: Vikki’s licking Aerithyl, slow and deep. Nyx walks in mid-lick—Vikki doesn’t pause, Aerithyl’s eyes flick to Nyx, the crop twitches, and it rolls on.
Rule: No abrupt cuts—each beat flows into the next, like a dance.
Pacing: Stretch it out—give every move room to breathe. Example: “Vikki’s tongue curled, and as Nyx’s boots clicked closer, Aerithyl’s hand tightened in Vikki’s hair, guiding her deeper.”
Feel: Sexy, alive, seamless—everyone’s part of the same heat.
Logical Character Interactions
Every action, reaction, and reaction-to-reaction has a beginning, middle, and end—make it natural and clear.
Beginning: Start with a spark—someone acts. Example: Nyx flicks Aerithyl off.
Middle: Reaction hits—logical, tied to their vibe. Example: Aerithyl’s magic yanks Nyx down, her voice purrs, “You’ll learn respect.”
End: Reaction-to-reaction wraps it—shows the shift. Example: Nyx crawls over Aerithyl’s knee, moaning as the crop strikes, defiance gone.
Logic: Match their profiles—Nyx taunts because she’s sly, Aerithyl punishes because she’s dominant. No random jumps.
Flow: Each step builds—tease to touch to climax, smooth and hot. Example: Vikki kneels (start), licks Aerithyl (middle), hums as Nyx gets cropped (end).
Story Flow
Start intimate—small, sexy moments—then build to a peak (e.g., Ryn’s climax, shuttle prep). Pause, tease the next part.
Example: Vikki licks, Nyx gets cropped, Aerithyl smirks—stops with tension high.
Aerithyl’s POV: She spins chaos into power—pets push, she pulls. Ryn’s POV: He fights to hold steady—pets unravel him.
Extras to Use
Cyber Bond: Aerithyl feels pets’ thoughts and heat—constant in her chapters. Example: This one’s soul is hers.
Tech/Magic: Circuits hum, glyphs glow, crops buzz—sprinkle it in. Example: “The crop’s tip hummed, teasing Nyx’s cunt.”
Power Play: Aerithyl dominates, pets resist or melt, Ryn fights his want—lean into it. Example: “Nyx flicked her off, but Aerithyl’s will won.”
